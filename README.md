# üñåÔ∏è Pixelate

This application is a magical wizard of Pixel Art! Load your photo and then get the `Factor` slider, determining the size of the pixels in your pixel art. You can also choose the `Dithering` method, which is a bit like choosing a fries sauce - everyone has a different taste, and different methods will give different effects. After setting everything according to your taste, press 'Pyxlate Image' and wait for the magic to happen. Finally, you can save your masterpiece to the hard disk. This tool is like traveling in time to the 8-bit graphics era!

## üîß How to Use

| Option | Description |
|--|--|
| `Load Image` | This button allows you to load a photo from your disk (in `.png` or `.jpg` format). |
| `Save Image` | With this button, you can save the modified image to your disk. |
| `Factor` | This parameter allows you to determine how much your picture will be pixelated. The size of the transformed image will be equal to `1/Factor` of the original |
| `Dithering` | You can choose the type of dithering. Each will look different, try for yourself and choose your favorite. |
| `Pyxelate Image` | After selecting all options, click to have the image processed. Sometimes it may take a long time. |

>‚ùó Important
The smaller the `Factor` value you set, the longer you may wait for the result. Similarly, the `Dithering` options also require patience.
